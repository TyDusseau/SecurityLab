# Implementing a SOC and Honeynet in Azure

The Security Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. Utilizing OSINT, threat maps were generated to help identify geographical attack locations which could be further utilized to improve security posture. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Threat mapping using IP address routing tools and OSINT.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
- OSINT tools such as IP address lookup to generate real-time threat mapping.
