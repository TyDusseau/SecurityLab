# Implementing a SOC and Honeynet in Azure

In this security lab project, my aim was to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. My primary focus was on ingesting and analyzing logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. By utilizing OSINT, I created threat maps to help identify geographical attack locations, which could be further leveraged to enhance security posture. This hands-on experience was crafted to deepen my understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.
### Skills Learned

- Proficiency in managing and utilizing Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems for collecting, correlating, and analyzing security event data.
- Ability to parse, interpret, and derive insights from logs generated by various network devices and systems, enhancing understanding of system behavior and potential security issues.
- Ability to create and utilize threat maps to visualize potential attack locations and identify geographical patterns, aiding in enhancing security posture.
- Practical experience gained through hands-on engagement with security tools, systems, and methodologies, enhancing overall proficiency in cybersecurity practices and techniques.

### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) System: Centralized platform for ingesting, correlating, and analyzing security event data from various sources.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
- Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) used for gathering and analyzing publicly available data such as IP address source location to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities.
