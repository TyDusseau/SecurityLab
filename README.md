# Implementing a SOC and Honeynet in Azure

In this security lab project, my aim was to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. My primary focus was on ingesting and analyzing logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. By utilizing OSINT, I created threat maps to help identify geographical attack locations, which could be further leveraged to enhance security posture. This hands-on experience was crafted to deepen my understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.
### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Threat mapping using IP address routing tools and OSINT.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) System: Centralized platform for ingesting, correlating, and analyzing security event data from various sources.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
- Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) Tools: Used for gathering and analyzing publicly available data such as IP address source location to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities.
